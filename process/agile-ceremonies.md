# Agile ceremonies

Agile is the defacto method of software development used by modern software organizations. It's an umbrella term for a set of frameworks and practices based on the values and principles expressed in the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/the-agile-manifesto/). 

The one thing that separates Agile from other approaches to software development is the focus on the people doing the work and how they work together. It's all about cross-functional teams collaborating in the best way to deliver software on time and within budget.
