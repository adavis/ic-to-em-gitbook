# Team communications

As managers, we receive a constant stream of information. We're in endless meetings, multiple Slack threads, and cc'd via email. But how can we best use this knowledge stream to help our team move forward?  We need to be able to properly synthesize what we've learned and then disseminate it to the appropriate people in the appropriate manner at the appropriate time.
